# Single-Cell Multi-Omics And Bulk RNA-seq Analysis of Human Dendritic Cell Homeostatic Maturation

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis pipelines, data preprocessing scripts, and visualization tools used in our study of dendritic cell (DC) homeostatic maturation. We employ single-cell multi-omics approaches to unravel the molecular mechanisms underpinning DC maturation and its role in maintaining immune tolerance.

## Data and Results
- **Raw Data:** Raw Input datasets are available @ GEO.
- **Input Data** Tabular-format input data used for analysis are available at the root directory of each section and those of single-cell omics are available @ Figshare due to file size limitations.
- **Figures and tables:** Graphs and tables that appeared in the manuscript are generated in `Outputs/` folders of each section.
- **Processed single-cell multi-omics results:** The processed Seurat (rds) or Scanpy (h5ad) objects are available @ Figshare.

## Contact
For questions or collaborations, please contact Harris Han(HarrisHan@hotmail.com) or the corresponding author Dr. Liang Cheng (liangcheng@whu.edu.cn). Note that Dr. Qiu-Chen Zhao (qz305@cam.ac)and Dr. Hao Yang (yanghao@whu.edu.cn) also contributed a lot to this project, especially the preprocessing of the scATAC-seq and CyTOF data (Qiu-Chen) and comparative analysis with skin DCs (Hao), contacting these two brilliant researchers is highly recommended if there is related questions.
