# Single-Cell Multi-Omics And Bulk RNA-seq Analysis of Human Dendritic Cell Homeostatic Maturation

## Abstract
Dendritic cells (DCs) serve as central regulators of immune activation and tolerance. While DC-mediated protective immunity is well-established, the mechanisms underlying human peripheral tolerance remain unclear. Through multi-omics analysis of human splenic DC maturation trajectories, we identified a homeostatic maturation program in type 2 conventional DCs (cDC2s). These homeostatically matured cDC2s (DC2hm) demonstrated coordinated upregulation of (1) tolerance-associated transcripts (including tissue-restricted self-antigens), (2) regulatory T cell (Treg)-polarization machinery, and (3) the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor complex (IL7Rα/TSLPR). Functionally, IL7Rα+CCR7+ DC2hm exhibited potent capacity to convert naïve CD4+ T cells into FOXP3+ Tregs. Remarkably, TSLP stimulation recapitulated the DC2hm phenotype in both human ex vivo models and humanized mice, establishing this cytokine as a critical regulator of DC-mediated tolerance. Our findings delineate a human cDC2 homeostatic maturation program and identify DC2hm as potential/critical mediators of human peripheral tolerance, providing new insights into autoimmune disease mechanisms and tolerance-inducing therapeutic strategies.

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis pipelines, data preprocessing scripts, and visualization tools used in our study of dendritic cell (DC) homeostatic maturation. We employ single-cell multi-omics approaches to unravel the molecular mechanisms underpinning DC maturation and its role in maintaining immune tolerance.
